# Data Structures

# What are Data Structures

## Java Collections Framework

A collection is a single object that represents a group of object. The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that provide unified (common/shared) architecture for repreesnting and manipulating collections. The top-level interface is the **`Collection`** interface. The main collections framework elements are in `java.util`.

## Data Structure

A data structure is a collection of objects, the relationships among them, and the functions and operations that can be applied to them. (e.g. sorting, searching, etc)

### Static Data Structure

A static data structure has a fixed size. The content can be modified, but without changing the size of the allocated memory

### Dynamic Data Structure

A dynamic data structure does not have a fixed size. The content can be modified, but without changing the size of the allocated memory

# Arrays

Array are **static** (fixed size) data structure that stored items sequentially. They are allocated in memory as a contiguous block of memory. Due to this, they have an $O(1)$ time complexity for access when the index is known.

# ArrayList

An ArrayList is a List (sequential collection) that works as a pseudo-dynamic array. It contains an array as an instance variable.

An ArrayList has a size and a capacity. The size is the number of elements in the list and the capacity is the size of the backing array.

When the size reaches the capacity, a new array with double the capacity is created and the data is copied over to that new array.

## Important Properties

### Type Parameters

ArrayLists have a singular type argument with defaults to Object.

```java
ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
```

This type must be an object (`Integer` instead of `int`).

```java
ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();

ArrayList<int> arrayList = new ArrayList<>(); // NOT ALLOWED
```

This provides compile time type safety and additionally makes casting not required when accessing objects.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(10);
numbers.add("Test") // COMPILE-TIME ERROR
```

### Initial Capacity

An initial capacity can be specified as a parameter.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(100); // Initial capacity of 100 elements
```

# LinkedLists

A linked list is a sequential dynamic data structure composed of **nodes**. Each node holds a value (object reference) and a pointer/reference to the next node. The last nodeâ€™s pointer points to null. This allows the data to be stored non-contiguously, even though you are using more memory to hold a pointer.

Linked lists can be singly linked (link to the next node) or double linked (link to the previous node)

An minimal implementation of the schema of both are below:

**Singly-linked list**

```java
class LinkedList <T> {
	private Node head;

	class Node <T> {
		private Node next;
		private T value;
	}
}
```

**Doubly-linked list**

```java
class LinkedList <T> {
	private Node head;
	private Node tail;

	class Node <T> {
		private Node next;
		private Node prev;
		private T value;
	}
}
```

# Stacks

Stacks is an abstract dynamic data structure which only allows access from the top of the stack. You can add to the top (**push**), access the top (peek), remove from the top (**pop**).

The stack is a relatively simply data structure but has many applications, especially in the call stack of programming languages.

In Java, this is implemented similar with a Vector, as the data must be contiguous.

## The Program Call Stack

In the execution of any language with functions, when function is called, a **frame** is pushed onto the call stack and executed with its own local variables. When the function returns, the frame is popped from the call stack, removed from the memory, and execute continues using from return link to the previous function.

# Trees

Trees are a recursive abstract data structure encompassing many implementations. They consist of nodes which point to children node(s)

## Traversals

We can either traverse iteratively with a queue (breadth first) or a stack (depth first), or use recursion and the implicit program call stack (depth first)

### Pre-Order Depth First Traversal

In pre-order depth first traversal, we process the current node and then call the method recursively on the left and right subtrees.

### Post-Order Depth First Traversal

In pre-order depth first traversal, we call the method recursively on the left and right subtrees and then process the current node.

### In-Order Depth First Traversal

In pre-order depth first traversal, we call the method recursively on the left subtree, process the current node, and then call the method recursively on the right subtree.

## Deleting a Node

Deleting a node with no or one child is easy.

Deleting a node with no children requires a bit more thought. We can either take the maximum node on the left subtree or take the minimum node on the right subtree and replace the selected node with that node.

## Unbalanced Trees

Ideally, we want the left and right subtree of the root to differ by a maximum level of 1 to maximum efficiency.
